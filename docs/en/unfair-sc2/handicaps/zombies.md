# ZOMBIES

Every ~43 seconds (can be changed) zombies are spawn near random player's structure. Their number is increased per every wave (max to 20 zombies). First wave is only with single zombie. After 6th, 12th and 18th (by default) wave zombies upgrades are increased to +1 lvl attack and armor. Marker on minimap is shown before zombies spawn. Countdown is also shown for players.
 
Every zombies wave has a single unit-detector.

It's possible to set that zombies should get upgrades after waves 6/12/18, 7/14/21, 8/16/24, 9/18/27 or 10/20/30.

Option **Zombies Start Delay** set delay for first wave with zombies. By default it's 0 seconds. So, first wave going to be at ~45s (it's default value for "Zombies Waves Delay"). So, if "Zombies Start Delay" is set to 60, first wave will be at ~105s.
